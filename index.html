                        <p>
                           Teenagers spend a lot of time online and may face risks such as cyberbullying or being exposed to inappropriate content.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Online</h3>
                        <p>
                           Being 'online' simply means that your computer or hand-held device is connected to a network, usually the internet. 
                           The opposite is 'offline', which means that a computer is disconnected from the internet or other network.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Internet</h3>
                        <p>
                           The internet is a telecommunications network that uses telephone lines, cables, 
                           satellites and wireless connections to connect computers and other devices to the World Wide Web. All modern computers can connect 
                           to the internet, as can many mobile phones and some televisions, video game consoles and other devices.

                        <h3>Introduction to Internet Safety</h3>
                        <p>Internet safety, or online safety, is the knowledge of maximizing the user's personal safety and security risks on private information 
                           and property associated with using the internet, and the self-protection from computer crime in general. As the number of internet users 
                           continues to grow worldwide, internet safety is a growing concern for both children and adults.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Common concerns regarding safety on the 
                           internet include: malicious users (Spam, Phishing, Cyberbullying, Cyberstalking etc.), websites and software (Malware, Computer Virus, etc.) 
                           and various types of obscene or offensive content. Several crimes can be committed on the Internet such as stalking, identity theft and more. 
                           Most social networking and chat sites have a page about safety. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Numerous groups, governments and organizations have expressed concerns about the 
                           safety of children using the Internet.

                        <h3>Passwords - Safety guidelines</h3>
                        <p>
                           Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your computer. 
                           The stronger your password, the more protected your computer will be from hackers and malicious software. 
                           You should make sure you have strong passwords for all accounts on your computer. 
                        </p>
                        <p>- Don’t just use one password</p>
                        <p>- Create passwords that are easy to remember but hard for others to guess.</p>
                        <p>- Make the password at least 8 characters long.</p>
                        <p>- Include numbers, capital letters and symbols.</p>
                        <p>- Don’t use dictionary words.</p>

                        <h3>Keeping Computer from Internet Threats</h3>
                        <p>
                           If you connect to the Internet, allow other people to use your computer, or share files with others, you should take steps to protect 
                           your computer from harm. Why? Because there are computer criminals (sometimes called hackers) who attack other people's computers. 
                           These people can attack directly, by breaking into your computer through the Internet and stealing your personal information, or indirectly, 
                           by creating malicious software to harm your computer.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>These are ways to help protect your computer against potential security threats:</p>
                        <p> - Firewall. A firewall can help protect your computer by preventing hackers or malicious software from gaining access to it.</p>
                        <p> - Virus protection. Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses, worms, and other security threats.</p>
                        <p> - Spyware and other malware protection. Antispyware software can help protect your computer from spyware and other potentially unwanted software.</p>
                        <p> - Windows Update. Windows can routinely check for updates for your computer and install them automatically.</p>

                        <p>Email is a wonderful tool for sending and receiving a lot of information quickly and securely.</p>
                        <p>However, it’s important that your personal information remains secure and safe and that you aren’t open to viruses or hackers.</p>
                        <p>Here are some safety tips when using email:</p>
                        <p>- Change your password regularly and keep it in a safe place. </p>
                        <p>- Don’t share your password with anyone. </p>
                        <p>- Don’t open attachments from anyone you don’t know. </p>
                        <p>- Log out or sign off from your account when you’ve finished looking at/sending your email. </p>
                        <p>- Don’t reply to spam or forward chain emails. Keep your personal information personal – don’t share bank or credit card information by email.</p>
                        <p>- Make sure that you have antivirus software installed and keep it up to date. </p>

                        <h3>Protecting Your Financial Transactions</h3>
                        <p>
                           Using the internet to buy items or services can save a lot of time and effort. 
                           However, there are unfortunately some risks when online shopping including fraud if you’ve made payments over unsecured web pages.
						   It’s important to know who you are buying from, how much you are paying and that your purchase is secure and safe.
                        </p>
                        <p>- Paying by credit card offers greater protection against fraud than with other methods.</p>
                        <p>- Double check all details of your payment before confirming.</p>
                        <p>- Before entering payment details on a website, ensure that the link is secure.</p>
                        <p>- When making a payment to an individual use a secure payment site such as PayPal – never transfer the money directly into their bank account.</p>
                        <p>- Check the website’s privacy policy.</p>
                        <p>- Always log out of sites into which you have logged in or registered details. Simply closing your browser is not enough to ensure privacy.</p>
                        <p>- Check credit card and bank statements carefully after payment to ensure that the correct amount has been debited, and also that no fraud has taken place as a result of the transaction. </p>

                        <h3>Social Networking and Communication Guidelines</h3>
                        <p>Social networking websites like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and Windows Live Spaces are services teenagers can use to connect with others to share information 
                           like photos, videos, and personal messages. As the popularity of these social sites grows, so do the risks of using them. Hackers, spammers, virus writers, 
                           identity thieves, and other criminals follow the traffic. 
                        </p>
                        <p>- Use caution when you click links</p>
                        <p>- Know what you’ve posted about yourself.</p>
                        <p>- Don’t trust that a message really is from whom it says it’s from. </p>
                        <p>- To avoid giving away e-mail addresses of your friends, do not allow social networking services to scan your e-mail address book. </p>
                        <p>- Type the address of your social networking site directly into your browser or use your personal bookmarks.</p>

                        <h3>Cyber Bullying </h3>
                        <p>
                           Don’t respond. If someone bullies you, remember that your reaction is usually exactly what the bully wants. 
                           It gives him or her power over you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Don’t retaliate. Getting back at the bully turns you into one and reinforces the bully’s behavior. Help avoid aggression.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Block the bully. If the harassment’s coming in the form of instant messages,
                           Use preferences or privacy tools to block the person. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Don’t be a bully. How would you feel if someone harassed you? 
                           Even a few seconds of thinking about how another person might feel can put a big damper on aggression.

                        <h3>Wireless and Mobile Device Safety</h3>
                        <p>If you are using a wireless network (also known as Wi-Fi) to access the internet, then you need to make sure it is secure; 
                           otherwise, all of your activity and information could be accessible to hackers and cybercriminals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           - Limit your signal strength so that it cannot be detected beyond the boundaries of your home.
                        </p>
                        <p>- Disable SSID broadcasting so your network is not visible to other wireless users within its signal range.</p>
                        <p>- Use a strong password. You should choose a password or passphrase that's easy for you to remember, but hard for other people to guess.</p>
                        <p>- Enable MAC (Media Access Control) address filtering to prevent unauthorized wireless clients from breaking into your network.</p>
                        <p>- Make sure your network utilizes WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) or WPA2.</p>
                        <p>- If you use the older WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) instead of WPA, then make sure to maximize the encryption.</p>
